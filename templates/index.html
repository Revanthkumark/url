                <li>Phishing is a cybercrime where attackers impersonate trusted organizations, like banks or companies, to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or personal data.</li>
                <li>They commonly send fake emails, messages, or create websites that closely resemble legitimate ones to deceive users into sharing their information.</li>
                <li>Attackers use tactics like creating urgency, such as warnings about account suspension, or offering fake rewards to trick victims into acting quickly without thinking.</li>
                <li>To spot phishing, always check for unusual email addresses, spelling errors, and mismatched or suspicious links. Hover over links to verify their authenticity before clicking.</li>
                <li>Protect yourself by using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping antivirus software updated. Never share personal information unless you’re certain the request is genuine.</li>
                <li>Staying cautious and informed about phishing scams can help prevent identity theft, financial loss, and account compromise.</li>

                <li>Malware is malicious software designed to harm or exploit any device, service, or network. It can infect your device through email attachments, malicious websites, or downloads.</li>
                <li>Common types of malware include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware, each with different purposes but often aiming to steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, or demand ransom.</li>
                <li>Malware can spread through infected emails, files, or links, and may be disguised as legitimate software or updates. Always be cautious when downloading files from unfamiliar sources.</li>
                <li>To protect yourself from malware, avoid clicking on suspicious links, never download files from untrusted sources, and regularly update your antivirus software.</li>
                <li>Regularly scan your devices for malware, ensure your operating system and applications are up to date, and enable firewalls to add an extra layer of protection.</li>
                <li>Keeping your software and security measures updated is one of the best ways to prevent malware infections and safeguard your personal data and privacy.</li>

                <li>Website defacement occurs when an unauthorized user or attacker modifies the content of a website, usually to display their own message, image, or propaganda.</li>
                <li>These attacks can often go unnoticed until users report strange or inappropriate content. Defaced websites may contain offensive material or misinformation, affecting the site's credibility and reputation.</li>
                <li>Defacement can occur due to vulnerabilities in a website's security, such as outdated software, weak passwords, or inadequate protection against attacks. Attackers exploit these weaknesses to gain access and alter content.</li>
                <li>To prevent website defacement, always maintain up-to-date security patches, use strong authentication methods, and regularly back up website data to ensure you can recover from attacks.</li>
                <li>If you encounter a defaced website, avoid interacting with it. Inform the website administrators and avoid sharing personal or financial information until the issue is resolved.</li>
                <li>Being aware of defacement tactics and taking preventive measures can help protect your website and its users from this type of cyber attack.</li>
